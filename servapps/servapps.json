Stores info about games played, stream titles, duration, if the stream got muted from copyrighted music, etc. Viewer count logging with graphs. Chapters (titles and games) are written to the final video file. <a href='https://github.com/MrBrax/twitch-vod-chat'>Video player</a> with chat playback. Video cutter with chapter display for easy exporting, also cuts the downloaded chat for synced rendering. Notifications with optional speech when the website is open, get stream live notifications far earlier than the mobile app does. Writes a <a href='https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/'>losslesscut</a> compatible csv file for the full VOD, so you don't have to find all the games. Uses `ts` instead of `mp4` so if the stream or program crashes, the file won't be corrupted. Audio only support. Optionally either dumps chat while capturing or downloads the chat file after it's done. Basic tools for downloading any VOD, chat, or clip. Can be set to automatically download the whole stream chat to a JSON file, to be used in my <a href='https://github.com/MrBrax/twitch-vod-chat'>twitch-vod-chat</a> webapp or automatically burned in with <a href='https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader'>TwitchDownloader</a>.
